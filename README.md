# RTTS.sh
Red Team Tool Set RTTS.sh works on RPi 3b+ and 4, Debian Buster 10.  RPi3b+ best for monitor mode.  May work on other RPi's and Linux distros.  Quick install of common tools including wireshark and metasploit.  This script saved me a lot of time so that I didn't have to do everything manually every time I wanted a clean slate to work with, again :)   I created this repository so that others, may utilize this script to learn and try out some tools without having to know everything all at once!  I hope that this script encourages those new to Red Teaming to learn more!  Feel free to alter, add to and share this script!  If you better this script in any way, please let me know, I would really like to try it out!
All tools installed using this script, I take no credit for.  All credits go to the developers of each tool.  I only wrote this script to make installation of included tools to make things easier and faster.  See an entire list of tools included below.
